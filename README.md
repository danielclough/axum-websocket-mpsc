# Axum Websocket with MPSC

I got a bit confused trying to add the MPSC pattern to my project, so I created this separate repo in order to act as a reference guide for future projects.

This is modified from the original [Axum Chat Example (v0.7.3)](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/blob/axum-v0.7.3/examples/chat/src/main.rs) with names altered in order to follow what is happening a little more clearly.
